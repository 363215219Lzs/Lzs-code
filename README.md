# BCMC-Code
A new method without PH assumption to estimate dynamic hazard ratios (HRs) in a multi-state Markov modeling framework, which was integrated into a Bayesian regularized Cox survival model. This method estimated dynamic effect parameters over time points and state transition paths under the assumption of parameters smoothness and Markov property.
